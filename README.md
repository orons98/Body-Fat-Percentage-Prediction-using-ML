# Body-Fat-Percentage-Prediction-using-ML
#Project Overvew#
This project explores the use of machine learning tp estimate body fat percentage using anthropometric measurements. The goal is to devlop an accurate, accessible and non invasive model that overcomes the limitations of BMI and other traditional bod fat estimation techniques.

# Research Question
Can machine learning models accurately predict body fat percentage using simple body measurements, and how do they compare to traditional estiamtion methods?

# Objectives
- Identify key features (e.g.,waist, hip, weight) that contribute to accurate predictions.
- Develop and evaluate machine learning models for body fatestimation.
- Provide an accessible alternative to BMI, expensive medical tests, and subjective estimates

# Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/body-fat-prediction-dataset
- Contains anthropometric measurements
- Used for training and testing various ML models

# Technologies and Methods Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn (Data processing and Modeling)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualisation)

Models
- Methods for training the 3 models Linear regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Models are evaluated based RMSE, MAE and R2 Score
